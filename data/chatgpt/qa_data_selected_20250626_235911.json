      "summary": "Client-side frameworks like Angular were introduced as an easier and more organized approach to develop dynamic web apps without cumbersome maintenance.",
      "detailed": "The increasing complexity in websites necessitated a system that could handle complex logic while maintaining separation of concerns. VanillaJS was not equipped for this, especially with data handling across views which jQuery fell short on as well.",
      "whenToUse": "When developing advanced web applications like Single-Page Applications where Angular's capabilities shine in organizing code and easing maintenance effort",

      {
        "mistake": "Using raw VanillaJS to manage complex logic which results in hard-to-read and maintain code",
        "explanation": "This is wrong because it leads to bloated scripts that are difficult for multiple developers to understand. To fix this, modularizing the application using libraries like Angular can provide better structure."

      {
        "mistake": "Overusing jQuery without understanding its limitations which causes performance issues in large applications",
        "explanation": "JQuery is not optimized for handling data across multiple views and complex logic, leading to suboptimal application performances. One can avoid this by learning about client-side frameworks like Angular that are specifically designed with these tasks."
