        "summary": "Angular apps are built using TypeScript modules and a module loader to initialize components",
        "detailed": "An Angular application's functionality begins with the entry point, usually defined in `main.ts`. This file sets up an empty browser environment by creating elements that can host your app\u2019s views. It then calls `bootstrapModule` from `@angular/platform-browser`, passing it a module declaration (usually `AppModule`) which encapsulates component definitions.",
        "whenToUse": "When explaining the bootstrap process and initializing an Angular application for beginners or as part of setting up app structure",
        "realWorldContext": "In real world web development, such bootstrapping is essential when developing Single Page Applications (SPAs) using Angular to manage UI interactions efficiently without full page reloads."
      },
      {
        "summary": "The `angular.json` file dictates build configurations crucial for app deployment and running",
        "detailed": "This JSON configuration holds the key settings that tell the Angular CLI how your application should be built, including entry points like 'main.ts', which is used in conjunction with Webpack to generate bundles of code executable directly in a browser.",
        "whenToUse": "When preparing for deployment or optimizing build processes within an Angular project",
        "realWorldContext": "In enterprise-scale applications, understanding `angular.json` configurations is necessary when scaling the app across different environments and platforms."

    ],
    "answer": {
      "summary": "Angular apps start by bootstrapping a main module that contains all other component definitions which are then made interactive within an empty browser environment created in `main.ts`",
      "detailed": "The process begins when Angular locates the entry point, often defined as 'main.ts' in your application settings (within angular-cli or manually configured). At this line of code: [...], AppModule is bootstrapped by invoking a function from `@angular/platform-browser` library that initializes an empty browser environment and makes it ready for the main module to populate with components. This setup ensures efficient management, routing capabilities, and dynamic interactions without full page refreshes.",
      "whenToUse": "When instructing on Angular initialization steps or explaining component interaction within a live development setting",
      "realWorldContext": "Angular bootstrapping is widely used in web applications to deliver interactive user experiences by managing browser-hosted views, which are particularly relevant when developing modern SPAs with complex routing and data handling needs."
