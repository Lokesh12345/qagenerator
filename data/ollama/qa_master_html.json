      "summary": "Multipart form data is used to send file data in web forms.",

To handle this, the server-side code uses a specific content type in the response envelope, such as 'multipart/form-data'. The detailed explanation and examples would typically include code snippets and explanations of how to process file data received via multipart form data."
