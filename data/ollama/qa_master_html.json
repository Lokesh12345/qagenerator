    "answer": {
      "summary": "Multipart form data is used to send file data in web forms.",
      "detailed": "When a user submits a form that includes files (like an image or document), the browser sends this data as part of the HTTP request. To handle this, the server-side code uses a specific content type in the response envelope, such as 'multipart/form-data'. The detailed explanation and examples would typically include code snippets and explanations of how to process file data received via multipart form data."

        "explanation": "HTML tags are essential for defining structure, such as headings (`<h1>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and images (`<img>`). Without them, browsers won't understand the intended layout."

        "mistake": "Misplacing or forgetting closing tags",
        "explanation": "HTML documents must maintain a balance between opening and closing tags. Forgetting to close a tag can lead to errors in rendering and potential security vulnerabilities if data is being passed through the missing tag."
