      "detailed": "Void elements, also known as self-closing or empty elements, are those which either don't have content within them at all (like the line break `<br />`) or always contain a single piece of content and therefore never need to be closed with an ending tag. Examples include `<img>`, `<hr>`, and `<input>`."
