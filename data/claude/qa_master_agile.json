This approach allows teams to learn from previous iterations, incorporate feedback, and adjust their course based on real user experiences and changing requirements.",

      "detailed": "Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. It is built on three pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation. The framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers), events (Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment). Key advantages include increased productivity, better quality products, reduced time-to-market, higher customer satisfaction, better team morale, and clearer project visibility.",
