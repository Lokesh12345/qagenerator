      "detailed": "A REST resource is an abstract entity representing any information that can be named and accessed via the web.\n\n| Method/Keyword | When to Use | Code Syntax Example |\n|----------------|------------|-------------------|\n| Single Resource | For individual entities | `GET /api/users/123` |\n| Collection Resource | For groups of entities | `GET /api/users` |\n| Sub-resource | For nested relationships | `GET /api/users/123/orders` |\n\n- Resources should be nouns, not verbs\n- Use plural forms for collection resources\n- Keep resource naming consistent and hierarchical\n- Consider resource granularity carefully\n\n```http\n# Example Resource URIs\nGET /api/products/123           # Single product resource\nGET /api/products              # Collection resource\nPOST /api/products             # Create new product\nGET /api/products/123/reviews  # Nested resource\n```",
